**Chapter 1 folder - The Machine Learning Landscape:** simple example of training and running a linear model and KNN using Scikit-Learn

**Chapter 2 folder - End-to-end Machine Learning project:** building a model that estimates the median price of houses in California and first try at building a Titanic Survivor predictor

**Chapter 3 folder - Classification:** second try at building a Titanic Survivor predictor and a handwritten digits classifier using the MNIST dataset

**Chapter 4 folder - Linear Models:** trying the normal equation, linear regression with and without regularization, early stopping, logistic regression, polynomial regression, softmax regression, implementing softmax regression with early stopping from scratch

**Chapter 5 folder - SVMs:** training Linear, polynomial, and RBF SVMs for classification, and training SVM for regression

**Chapter 6 folder - Decision Trees:** training Decision Trees for classification and regression, visualizing the Tree using graphviz, and creating a sort of Random Florest using only the Decision Tree class

**Chapter 7 folder - Ensemble Learning:** trying voting classifiers, bagging and pasting ensembles, random forest, boosting, and stacking

**Chapter 8 folder - Dimensionality reduction:** trying PCA, randomized PCA, incremental PCA, random projection, LLE, MDS, t-SNE

**Chapter 9 folder - Unsupervised Learning:** trying K-Means, semi-supervised learning, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixtures, Bayesian Gaussian Mixtures, recognizing faces on the Olivetti dataset
